# What is this?
This is a small script that you can use in linux or on MacOs

It does most of the git-dance for you, instead of requiring you to type "git add ..." "git commit -m 'blabla'" and then git push, you just run the script and answer the questions.

It will show you which files are changed, which chunks are changed in those files and you can approve, deny, keep or edit etc.

Makes the git-dance very easy
